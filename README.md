Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The client Driver Pass was a company that specialized in driver training, providing students with on the road and written instruction. Their end goal was to help students
  pass their DMV drivers test. They wasnted us to design a system that would take this program online, allowing students to both take online courses and schedule in-person road training sessions.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  I think that in the first project I was able to determine the objectives and goals of the system adequately. I did this through reading the transcript of an interview with various members of Driver Pass and extrapolating different end results and system functions out of the discussion.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the Gnatt Chart and add a lot more detail. It lacks a color code system showing which teams are working on which sections of the project. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The users needs were interpreted from the interview conducted with Driver Pass, as well as from my own needs interacting with the education portal with SNHU. The user is the end party whom you build the system to serve. It is 
  of the utmost importance that they are able to derive the greatest amount of value, with the greatest ease of effort, to ensure a successful system.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I start from the perspective of a user. From that perspective it is easier to imagine what types of systems are needed, and how those systems can best be implemented. 
In the future I think I will also look at examples of similar systems to draw ideas from regarding the more peripheral functions of a system a user may only need every once and awhile.
